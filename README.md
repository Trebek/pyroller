PyRoller: Dice Module
=============================

[**Try a demo here!**](http://repl.it/NVc)

A relatively simple dice module, containing methods to roll, sum, and average the sums of instantiated dice. Has a few extra, handy features built in.

**Features:**

- Construct dice objects, where each object can represent any number of dice with any number of sides.
- Accepts/parses (as a string) standard dice notation (d6, 3d6, d20, etc.) for constructing dice.
- Can simulate coins, for coin tosses.
- Can simulate Fudge dice.
- Can construct "bags" of dice, using the `makebag` function, and feeding it a list of dice notations.
- And more!
